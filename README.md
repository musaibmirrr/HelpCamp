# HelpCamp
HelpCamp is a full-stack web application that enables users to create, view, and review campgrounds. Designed as an interactive platform for outdoor enthusiasts, this project allows registered users to share their favorite campgrounds with others by adding new campground entries and reviewing existing ones, while authentication and authorization ensure only authorized users can modify content. This project is part of Colt Steeleâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, where it serves as a practical application of full-stack web development skills. Musiab(Me) has contributed to this project by implementing a review system with fake review detection using a library NLP natural.
